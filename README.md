# plu-codes
Small Python script made to help me memorize PLU codes at my work

All documentation in the main.py are in french, but Google Translate should be okay to understand what it is written.
You can do what you want with the code, even take all credits. This script has been coded in 1.5h at midnight while I didn't could find sleepness
